This will be my first website for my personal portfolio.
The goal will be to: 

    1.Complete this website (bonus for mobile) by January 8th.
    2.Show case my HTML/CSS and Javascript abilities that I have learned over the past few months.
    3.Build good coding habits 

In order to do this I will make be doing my best to code for at least one hour every day and hopefully continue this habit throughout the next semester of classes.
